Doctor... The internet has confused me with too many options That's why I'm here. I need some help. I... I want to kill myself. Suicide. I haven't showered in a week... nor have I spoken to anyone. Even my ceiling fan stopped responding. Maybe I'm going insane. Slightly, but... The homes and hearts of you... South Indians are the same... completely hollow. How can I forget... I've replayed that day in my mind a thousand times. And what is this supposed to be? Sam bar. Ls there a problem? Just one problem. You! If you have a problem, keep moving. Excuse me! You're cutting the line. How will he eat if he doesn't cut the line?! I've been the 'Head Cook' here for 10 years! Not a single 'complan' against my sambar!
